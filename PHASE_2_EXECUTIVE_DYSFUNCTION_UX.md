## Phase 2 Completion Prompt

```
I need to verify that Phase 2 (Executive Dysfunction UX) has been fully implemented for the Executive Dysfunction Center application. Please perform a comprehensive evaluation of:

1. **Task Breakdown Interface**: Test all task breakdown components including difficulty indicators, time estimates, subtask management, and progress tracking. Verify that complex tasks are properly broken down into manageable steps.

2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Evaluate all collapsible sections, guided workflows, and information hierarchy. Ensure cognitive load is minimized while maintaining full functionality access.

3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Check that priority indicators, next action cues, and state indicators are clear and consistent. Verify visual noise is minimized and attention is properly directed.

4. **Executive Function Support**: Test cognitive accessibility features including memory aids, attention management, and planning support. Verify these features reduce cognitive burden.

5. **User Testing Results**: Analyze feedback from users with executive dysfunction. Ensure pain points have been addressed and task initiation is improved.

Provide a detailed report with:
- Completion status of all UX enhancements
- User testing results and feedback incorporation
- Cognitive load reduction measurements
- Task completion rate improvements
- Recommendations for Phase 3 component standardization

Only proceed to Phase 3 after achieving satisfactory user testing results and measurable UX improvements.
```

## Next Phase Preparation

Before proceeding to Phase 3, ensure:
- User testing has been completed with target demographics
- Cognitive load reduction has been measured and validated
- Task breakdown features are fully functional
- Progressive disclosure patterns are implemented consistently
- Visual hierarchy improvements are tested and refined
